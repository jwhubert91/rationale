For Schick, Rationale created a flexible high-level system to create a master-brand platform for all current and future products, including extension products.
The system provides category-beating visibility of the Schick name, rational and clear product information hierarchy, and a fresh, white space to immediately create a break in the shaving aisle & demand attention. The system also announces new type and graphic standards to be repeated in all Schick communications, creating an instantly recognizable look & feel to the brand.
