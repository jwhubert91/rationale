Many visual metaphors can signify film, but most of these are too referential to the previous, analog era. The solution here achieves something more universal and transcendent: Transitioning groups of lines suggest the transitioning frames of a movie as well as the turning pages of a book.

Limited-edition film festival poster designed by Sean Wolcott of Rationale. Giclée printed at A1 large-format size on enhanced matte paper with deep and vibrant colors. Signed and numbered on the back by the designer. Shipped in a heavy-duty mailing tube ready to be framed or hung as is.
